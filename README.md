# LeetCode Python Solutions
A simple Python project for experimenting with solutions to various LeetCode problems.
The goal of this repository is to provide clear, test‑driven implementations using modern Python tooling.

# Features

# Solutions implemented in Python
Tests written with pytest
Managed and executed using uv, a fast Python package and project manager
Clean project structure suitable for experimentation or extension

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
Make sure you have uv installed:
```bash
pip install uv
```
Or follow installation instructions from the official uv repository.
## Install Dependencies

## Running Tests
Execute all tests with:
```bash
uv run pytest
```
